## Acknowledgment

This plugin was inspired by Yacine Benaffane (yacineMTB) and his [dingllm.nvim](https://github.com/yacineMTB/dingllm.nvim) project. Although it contains less features, this plugin will gradually be improved and is primarily meant to be a personal learning project.

- Support for both Anthropic (Claude), other LLMs will be added later
- Easy to use commands and optional key mappings

- Neovim >= 0.7.0
- [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)

## Configuration

Set your API keys as environment variables:

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
```

## Usage
